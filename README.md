### Hi there 👋

I'm looking for a PhD position, I just graduated from BUAA in June 2023 and got my bachelor’s degree from NUAA in June 2020. 👀

My research interests are wireless communication and communication networks.

I have studied the 802.11 physical layer simulation and the queue delay analysis based on the effective capacity model.

I find these studies interesting and want to learn more:
  - **wireless communication networks**
  - mobile edge computing 
  - AIoT
  - quantum communication (awesome🤖)

💬 Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any additional information. [My email](junjiewu97@outlook.com)👈🏻
