### Hi there 👋

I am working as a wireless communication engineer. And I enjoy exploring various wireless communication technologies.

I find these studies interesting and want to learn more:
  - integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
  - time-sensitive communication
  - non-terrestrial networks (NTN)
  - RIS-aided communication
  - quantum communication (boson sampling)
